This bot was made as part of a test on the subject of programming, it has simple functionality and a database in sqlite3 which is built into the program code itself, the bot implements the functions of creating a user profile, editing every aspect of the profile (description, photo, name, age, gender ), viewing profiles of other users and receiving a telegram from the user you want to contact.
Perhaps I missed something or forgot, but still, you will need to add your unique token and a database to the bot, which will be automatically created when you use the bot
If you have any questions about using this bot, you can contact me in telegram @tehenmei
